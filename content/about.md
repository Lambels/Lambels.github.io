>Hello, my name is Patrick Arvatu, and go online by Lambels. I am (try to be) a very enthusiastic and hard working: software developer, hockey player and student. I thoroughly enjoy spending time with my friends, playing hockey and programming. Each day I strive in becoming better then before and learning something new.

## üë®‚Äçüéì Skills and Accomplishments:
A brief collection of knowledge and achievements ive accumulated throughout my life time.

### Golang:
Ive been using golang for around **3 years** now. Although I still consider myself a rookie I have accumulated some knowledge throughout the projects ive built.

### Hockey:
Ive been playing hockey semi professionally (child level) for 7 years. I currently play for Corona Barsov U18 team. I have several appearances in the Romanian National Team throughout my hockey career and won the Romanian Championship (with Corona Barsov) several times.

### Debate:
I love debate and public speaking. It really is the one thing I wish I could do more of, but currently cant. My involvement in debate is minimal currently, but I am on my school debate team and certainly very passionate about debate in general.

## üèó Projects:
These projects are the result of 3 years of working with golang. The order represents the quality of the projects (decreasing order) as I see them.

### [Sinoname](https://github.com/Lambels/sinoname):
[Sinoname](https://github.com/Lambels/sinoname) is a highly customizable, flexible, extensible, out of the box ready, pipeline for generating similarly looking strings. It is very good in generating similar looking usernames when the initial username is not available.

### [Cronjob](https://github.com/Lambels/cronjob):
[Cronjob](https://github.com/Lambels/cronjob) is a cron like scheduler which uses [golang time specification](https://pkg.go.dev/time) for scheduling jobs. Cronjob has a very clean and intuitive api which provides great user experience.

### [Relationer](https://github.com/Lambels/relationer):
[Relationer](https://github.com/Lambels/relationer) provides a real-time interface to view simple relationships (graph relationships) between people. The relationer server produces messages which are sent to a centralized message broker to be consumed by you on either: the relationer cli receiving point, provided frontend, or your own customizable app.

### [Autho](https://github.com/Lambels/autho):
[Autho](https://github.com/Lambels/autho) is a customisable and clean implementation of all OAuth and OAuth2.0 web providers with full implementation for popular providers such as twitter, facebook, github and google. Autho helps you focus on the logic side of your application whilst providing an idiomatic api to handle the boilerplate.
